<p>I'm Phillip Nkuna, a seasoned forex trader and Founder of Forex Future Malawi. Together with my trading partner,Co-Founder Akogho Mwentembela, also known as Oracle 1, we specialize in forex trading and synthetic indices such as boom and crash. Our trading strategy is adaptable and can be applied to various trading instruments.

With a combined experience of over five years in the forex market, we have successfully mentored and guided more than 100 students in their journey towards financial independence. One of our notable achievements includes passing a challenge from a renowned pro firm, MyFundedfx.

The spark for my forex trading career ignited after diving into financial literature, particularly books like 'Rich Dad Poor Dad.' I yearned for a way to work independently, without relying on traditional customer-centric businesses or being confined to regular employment structures.

Driven by our desire to pave the way for ambitious individuals in Malawi to venture into currency exchange, we established Forex Future Malawi. Our primary focus is on providing top-quality financial education based on the wealth of experience we have gained over the past four years.

We invite passionate souls to join us on this journey of empowering themselves with knowledge and skills to thrive in the forex market. Together, let's unlock the potential for financial freedom."</p>
